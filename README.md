# Dishwashers webapp
## Main Requirements
Build a webapp that allows customers to see the range of dishwashers.  
Should work on a tablet (seems to be the main focus) such as an iPad (768x1024), in landscape and portrait mode.   
The initial page (product grid) should show the first 20 results returned by the API.
